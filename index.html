		<p> It was 1783. Many things happened that year, the <a href = "https://worldhistoryproject.org/1783/2/5/calabrian-earthquake-of-1783">Calabrian Earthquake</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laki#Consequences_in_Iceland "> M&oacute;&#240;uhar&#240;indin</a>, and the American Revolution.</p>
		<!-- Viz. Stands for Videlict, which means "Namely" -->
		<p> 
			Most importantly, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the American Revolution that is often ignored: The Loyalists
			viz. the people that sided with the empire.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not everybody was enthusiastic to leave the Empire. Many people, such as Merchants, Civil servants, and all manner of people who found an excuse to leave -some were opposed to the revolution outright while others were just pacifist moderates who believed in diplomacy- who were all lumped together into the big group called the <a href = "http://www.uelac.org/"> Loyalists </a>. In total, they numbered about 80 000 to 100 000.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of these people were not rich or powerful (those who were knew better), but lay people like farmers, tradespeople, and workers. They were Aboriginals, Immigrants , Whites, Blacks, Slaves, Free, Rich, Mostly Poor, but they all had one thing in common, and that was that they supported Great Britain.
		</p>
		<p>
			But it was not easy being a loyalist. Those who dared to openly oppose the revolution were often dealt with by the mobs, with all sorts of cruel and unusual punishments such as <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarring_and_feathering"> tarring and feathering </a>(every bit as painful as it looked.), house burning, and other unpleasant acts such as mob beatings and even being thrown into prison. Their belongings were often stolen and vandalized, and they were humiliated as both entertainment and as a deterrent.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a result, many of them simply left. They packed up their bags, often abandoning what little they still had and relatives in the country, for Upper and Lower Canada, the promised land. 1783 – 1784 was so hectic that the 30 000 new immigrants arrived in the single year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many of these people left everything to come to Canada. Some people lost everything. For some, the experience was so harrowing that when the boats left, they cried into their forsaken land. Others set right to work, chopping down forests, removing rocks, and setting up homesteads.
		</p>
		<p>
			A quarter of them settled along the St.Lawrence, the rest going to places such as Quebec, Gaspé, Chaleur Bay, the Grand River, and many others. So many arrived in what is now Ontario that they created the new province of Upper Canada.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many of these people would prove Influential, such as Egerton Ryerson, the Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada, and the son of UEL Jospeh Ryerson whose policies and ideas from 1844 to 1878 influenced the highly populous region of present day Southern Ontario.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today, they continue to leave a lasting impression on Canada through the culture and tradition that they have brought to Canada, in spirit of unity and peace. They have established some of the oldest institutions in Canada and have and continue to leave their mark on the course of history. Today, we honor them for the things they sacrificed and sacrifice, from serving our country in the war of 1812 to the Invasion of Normandy and Canada’s role in the World Wars, and to Peacekeeping Missions today.
