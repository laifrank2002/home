		<h3> Before the Revolution</h3>
		<!-- Their Quote Not Mine -->
		<p>
		In general, Loyalists were those in the Thirteen Colonies who took arms for Britain instead of the Revolution. These include people from all walks of life, from peasants to wealthy merchants.
		In 1774, the First Continental Congress published a list of <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.10602600/" target ="_blank">resolves</a> titled &ldquo;At a meeting of the true sons of Liberty&rdquo;. Excerpt:
		<blockquote cite="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.10602600/">
			&ldquo; 14.RESOLVED, That the best way of approving our Loyalty, is to spit in the said King&rsquo;s Face; as that may be the Means of opening his Eyes. &rdquo;
		</blockquote>
		Except not all people felt that way about the King. Some people were afraid, others were genuinely in support of the King, and still most people were moderates who were opposed to such extremist views. But the Radicals, notably with Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, won by a slim majority, and so it was Resolved. Not everybody would accept that outcome, however. About a fifth of the population strongly objected to cutting ties with Britain, while another two fifths had no opinion on this issue.

			In fact, while some people took up arms in favor of the colonies, others took up the Royal Standard and joined the opposing side. It was a long and bloody war lasting decade's years that culminated in 1781, after General Cornwallisâ€™s famous surrender at Yorktown, Virginia. It officially ended with the Paris Treaty in 1783.

		<h3> After the Revolution</h3>
		<p>
			After the war, many of them then settled in Canada, but some stayed behind, and even moved to other commonwealth countries like New Zealand, Australia, and many others. But still, it is estimated that around 10% of Canadians are descended from the original loyalists.
			In 1782, October 19th, Tens of Thousands of Loyalists on 9 ships set sail from New York to Annapolis harbour. The following April brought 7,000 new refugees, and by early 1784 numbered to total of 30,000 and counting. The flood of refugees settled mostly in the Maritime Provinces , Upper Canada, and Quebec.

		<p>
			These people were then given the Honorific of UE viz. United Empire Loyalist to signify their sacrifice and devotion to their empire. Those who were eligible were as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>
				A male or female resident of the American Colonies prior to 19th April 1775 who joined the Royal Standard prior to the Treaty of Separation of 1783 or otherwise demonstrated loyalty to the Crown, and settled in territory remaining under the rule of the Crown; or
			</li>
			<li>
				A soldier who served in an American Loyalist Regiment and was disbanded in Canada; or
			</li>
			<li>
				A member of the Six Nations of either the Grand River or the Bay of Quinte Reserves who is descended from one whose migration was similar to that of the other Loyalists.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In total, estimates range from around 30,000 to over 100,000. As many as 3 million descendants of Loyalists are estimated to live in Canada today, mostly in Ontario and in the Maritimes. Their contributions are numerous and uncountable, from the fighting in War of 1812, the Invasion of Normandy, and even in the military today on UN peacekeeping missions. Do you know 10 people? Perhaps one of them is related to the fighting men and women who gave up everything to fight for the Empire.
