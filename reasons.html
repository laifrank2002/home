		<h2> Reasons for Revolution </h2>
		<p> 
			Conflict between Britain and it’s colonies was not unjustified. The Colonists and the Monarchy both argued each side had aggravated the other. As listed, these are some of the reasons why America and Britain were at each other&rsquo;s throats.
		</p>
		<h3> The French and Indian War </h3>
		<!-- IMG HERE -->

		<p>
			It was 1754, and Britain and France at war, like they had always been. This time, however, they were fighting in many places, and one of those places was called North America. An alliance consisting of Prussia and Great Britain were fighting the French, Russians, and Austrians.
		</p>
		<p>
			Britain and France had long disputed territories in Acadia, Quebec, the St. Lawrence River, and basically all of the land north of Spain’s Kingdom in North America. They finally decided to settle their disputes by a show of force, beginning a 7 year long war throughout Britain’s Possessions in British North America, Europe, and the Caribbean . In British North America The English had sent the brilliant general James Wolfe to deal with the experienced French Officer Louis-Joseph Montcalm. At the battle of the plains of Abraham, both of the commanders were killed, although the British managed to capture Quebec anyways. With the  long and bloody conflict finally over, the French were allowed a few Islands, and the British took control of the rest of the lands.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, the colonists, who had long fought for the right to settle into Native American land, were denied that right as the newly gained land from the French were given to the Native Americans. Even worse, the British were short on funds, so they had a law requiring the colonists to house rude British troops. But still, they tolerated the empire, for now.
		</p>
		<h3> The Sugar Act, The Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts </h3>
		<p>
			In 1764, Britain passed the sugar act, and in 1765 passed the Stamp act. Those acts put a minuscule tariff on imported sugar and on all printed materials in the colonies. Britain was short on cash after incurring large war debts from France, and needed money fast. However, the Rebellious Americans sought to actively avoid the tax through the employment of smuggling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Smuggling in Tea and Sugar was not limited to just criminals and the working class folks. Even many officials and lawmen disobeyed the law carelessly, and the courts refused to prosecute those charged with such a crime.
		</p>

		<p>
			Britain was not pleased. The Debt incurred from the Seven Year’s war was not a pretty number, and the chancellor of the exchequer needed to find new ways to raise funds.
		</p>
		<p>
			There, it dawned on him that if he actually enforced the taxes that Britain had set on America years ago, they would’ve had more flowing in even with a lower tax rate. So in fact, in 1767, Britain actually lowered the tax rate on many imported commodities, but instead of having the power to prosecute in the hands of the American Courts, they moved that power to the British Courts, who had a decidedly different approach to dealing with smugglers. While on paper it lowered the tax rate, in reality, it shot up, and the Americans were not happy about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			By then, the Colonists had grown angry, and were almost ready to riot. Actually, they were ready to riot. In Boston, many people showed up to the governor&rsquo;s mansion to protest the higher taxes, and it did not go well.
		</p>
		<h3> The Boston Massacre </h3>
		<p>
			1770 was a year of great tragedy. Protesters in Boston were fired into by the redcoats trying to calm everyone down. One of the deadliest protests up and until that point, it was deemed a massacre. It spawned outrage and protest, and journalists writing fiery pieces against Britain. The general mood of everybody was generally an anti-British sentiment.

		<p>
			3 years later in 1773, several young men, dressed as Native Americans, slipped onto a harbour and fed crate upon crate of tea to the fish in the harbour, in what would be known as the Boston Tea Party, a rallying symbol for the cause of the revolution. The following year, the First Continental Congress, spearheaded by these rebels, would declare a boycott of British Goods the next year, as well as reinstating self rule.
			These Massachusetts troublemakers would not get away so easily, however, and would be faced with increasingly outrageous and Draconian punishments.
		</p>
		<h3> The Quartering Act</h3>
		<p>
			1765 saw the beginning of what many colonists saw as unjust. Britain was really out of funds, so out of funds, that they had to choose between paying or housing the troops. They choose neither, and had the american colonists required by law to house British troops. While some made pleasant company, most were unruly grunts who caused great harm to whoever was unlucky enough to receive them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The citizenry actively disobeyed this law however they could, to the point that Parliament realized it cost more to enforce the act than if they actually just housed the troops themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			1774 saw this act reinstated as Parliament saw fit to punish the rebellious colonists with laws designed not to provide any actual benefit so much as calm down the rebels. As we’ll see later, it’ll have the exact opposite effect.
		</p>
		<h3> Beginning of the War </h3>
		<p>
			February 9, 1775. Parliament declared Massachusetts to be in open rebellion, and colonists began defensive preparations. In the April of that year, Governor Gage is ordered to use force to stamp out the rebellion. He then proceeds to order 700 soldiers to destroy a weapons cache in Concord. In the quiet night of April 18th, Paul Revere famously rides from Boston to warn the militiamen there.
		</p>
		<p>
			In what is regarded as the beginning of the war, a skirmish broke out between 70 colonists and the British troops at Lexington Green. The British won that fight, and proceeded to head to concord. After destroying the weapons cache, a platoon was defeated by the colonists there and the Army retreats to Boston, suffering 250 causalities along the way.
		</p>
		<p>
			News spread of what happens, and Congress drafts 13,600 colonists to arms. Volunteers flooded in from around the colonies. With that, began a 13 year war against Britain, and one of the most Consequential events in human history.
