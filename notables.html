			After the flood of refugees into Canada, Loyalists did not just sit around. They built homes, they farmed the land, they organized into townships,  and what society expected of them. There are some individuals, however,that are more well known and consequential than their peers. Below is a short list of a few notables.

		<h3>Adolphus Egerton Ryerson</h3>

		<p>
			A descendant of Lieutenant Joseph Ryerson UE, he spent his early life working for the Methodist church. After studying Greek & Latin in Hamilton, he became a circuit rider for the church. His first round was York, and this helped him understand the plight of the commoners there. After that, he published many articles and books on the topic of defending Methodism despite public opinion on it being “American”.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to that, he was elected by one vote to serve as the Founding Editor for the Christian Guardian, and used the post to argue for the rights of Methodists as well of publish his own opinion. He resigned in 1835, resumed his post in 1838, but was defeated in the 1840 election at 50-1.
		</p>
		<p>
			During that time, he had also help found the Upper Canada Academy, as well as serving as it’s president when it was renamed to Victoria College(Now part of U of T) . In 1844, he became the Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada, in which he pushed for and won many reforms that continue to shape Canada today.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ryerson had studied schools around the world, which would lead to the Common School Bill of 1846, which revolutionized schools in Canada with standards for teachers, libraries in every school,a devolved school board, and many others that we take for granted, as well as making schools free for children. This vastly improved the quality of education for children. But he also pushed for the Residential School system, a system that left scars that continue plague Canada to this day.
		</p>
		<p>
			His system included the First General Board of Education, consisting of a Superintendent and 6 other members appointed by the Governor General. The board was responsible for allocating and distributing funds among the 20 districts at the time, as well as directing normal schools(teachers colleges) and preparing an annual report, as well as establishing a list of acceptable and recommended textbooks.
		</p>
		<p>
			As well, he considerably expanded the role of District Superintendent to be able to allocate funds, report to the Superintendent, hiring/firing teachers, and many other responsibilities.He also pushed to make schools free for children, paid for by a property tax, like the american system, and that every child in Canada should not be deprived of education based on poverty or inability, in order to help less privileged children. This was achieved in the comprehensive school act of 1871.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually, he retired in 1876, with two kids, Charles Egerton Ryerson and Sophie Egerton Harris, the former of which became the secretary treasurer and assistant librarian of Toronto. Today, he lives on in his policies, his children, and what he did for Canada.

		<h3>Joseph Brant viz. Thayendanegea</h3>
		<img src="Images/JosephBrant.jpg" alt = "An artist&rsquo;s conception of Joseph Brant"height = "251" width = "200" class="center"/>
		<p>
			A statesman, loyalist, and war chief, Joseph Brant was one of the more notable Native Americans during his time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Born in March 1743 in the Ohio Territory, he was named Thayendanegea, after the word for two sticks bound together for strength. His father died while he was born. Afterwards, they moved to the Province of New York, in Canajoharie. When he was 10, his mother remarried to Brant(Canagaraduncka), a Mohawk leader with connections to British Officials. Brant(Canagaraduncka) had been a friend of William Johnson, the local superintendent for northern Indian Affairs, and after being introduced to him and his wealth, Brant(Thayendanegea) decided to stay with Johnson. This proved to be a good decision, as Johnson took up an interest in his education and introduced him to many powerful officials in New York.
		</p>
		<p>
			When he was around 18 years of age, he joined the Native Americans on the side of the British during the French and Indian War. He served in the 1759 Battle of Fort Niagara, the 1758 Battle of Fort Carillon, received a silver medal for his service.
		</p>
		<p>
			He later attended Moor’s Indian Charity School(Now known as Dartmouth College) after being arranged by Johnson to go there. A Brilliant Student there, he learned English, Math, as well as other Academia. After his education, he worked for nearly a decade as a translator and interpreter for the British Indian Affairs Department for William Johnson, and his successor, Guy Johnson.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the American Revolution, Brant Immediately joined the war on the British Side. He fought with an Aboriginal Loyalist regiment and was commissioned as a Captain in 1780, and also as a war chief by the Mohawks.  He was well respected as a capable soldier who striked fear into the hearts of American Settlers, and was regarded as the leader of the Native Americans.He regularly launched raids on American Settlements during the war, and used guerrilla style tactics to out manoeuvre the Americans.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the war ended in 1783, he campaigned hard for land rights as compensation for the heavy losses that they had suffered. The British had granted him a  large parcel of land near the Grand River, where he led the other Native-American Loyalists to settle peacefully. There, he died in his home, peacefully, as a man of great accomplishments. Today, he is remembered as a great leader, a capable fighter, and a supporter of Great Britain.
		</p>
		<p>
			He is celebrated in many museums and textbooks, and if you have time on August 4th, there is Joseph Brant Day in Burlington, just south of Oakville, where they host Native American Dances as well as Historical Reenactments.
